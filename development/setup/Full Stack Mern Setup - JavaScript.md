### 1. **Project Initialization**

#### 1.1 **Setting up the Project Directories**
```console
mkdir my-mern-app 
cd my-mern-app 
mkdir backend frontend`
```
#### 1.2 **Initializing Git Repository**

```console
git init
```

#### 1.3 **Initializing `package.json` for Both Frontend and Backend**

- **Backend:**
    ```console
	cd backend npm init -y
	```
- **Frontend:**
    ```
	cd ../frontend 
	npm create vite@latest
	```

- Select react with JavaScript in vite project initialisation.

This step initializes the backend with a `package.json` and creates the React frontend project in the `frontend` directory. You now have the basic folder structure and initial setups ready.

### 2. **Backend Setup**

- Installing Express and dependencies
- Setting up basic server with Express
- Connecting to MongoDB with Mongoose
- Creating RESTful API endpoints
- Setting up environment variables (dotenv)
- Configuring CORS
- Error handling middleware

### 3. **Frontend Setup**

- Creating React app using Create React App (CRA)
- Setting up routing with React Router
- Installing and configuring Axios for API calls
- Managing state with React Context or Redux
- Setting up basic pages and components

### 4. **Authentication and Authorization**

- Setting up user authentication (JWT)
- Implementing protected routes on both frontend and backend
- Managing user sessions

### 5. **Connecting Frontend and Backend**

- Configuring API calls from React to Express server
- Handling responses and errors
- State management for connected components

### 6. **Deployment Setup**

- Preparing the project for production
- Deployment with Heroku (Backend) and Netlify/Vercel (Frontend)
- Configuring environment variables in deployment environments

### 7. **Testing**

- Setting up Jest/React Testing Library for frontend testing
- Setting up Mocha/Chai for backend testing

### 8. **CI/CD Setup**

- GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools for automated testing and deployment

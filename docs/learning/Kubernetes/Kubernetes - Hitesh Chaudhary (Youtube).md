## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is a tool that helps manage and run containerized applications automatically, making it easier to deploy, scale, and maintain apps.
## Why use Kubernetes?

• **Scalability**: Automatically adjusts resources based on demand.
• **Automation**: Simplifies app deployment and updates.
• **Resilience**: Recovers from failures automatically.
• **Portability**: Works across different environments (cloud or on-premises).
• **Efficiency**: Makes better use of resources to save costs.

## Where is Kubernetes used?

• **Managing Microservices**: For running small, independent services.

• **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automates development workflows.

• **Cloud Applications**: For apps built to run in the cloud.

• **Hybrid Cloud**: Runs apps across cloud and local servers.

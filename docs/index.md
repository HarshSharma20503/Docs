# Welcome

Welcome to my personal documentation repository! This repo is a collection of the notes, guides, troubleshooting logs, and resources I use in my daily development. It includes everything from setting up full-stack applications to solving common errors.

The aim is not to create a general-purpose documentation that helps everyone, but rather something I can refer to when working on the same technologies or concepts in the future. This will provide verified code snippets and the correct way of doing things, avoiding trial and error, saving time, and increasing my efficiency in writing repeatable code. This allows me to focus on learning new things.

_Note_: This documentation does not contain everything I have learned. At times of urgency, I have not and may not document certain concepts or snippets. Hopefully, I will add them someday soon.

## Folder Structure

Below is an overview of the folder structure and what each section contains:

### `/development`

### `/error-solutions`

A collection of error logs and their corresponding solutions:
